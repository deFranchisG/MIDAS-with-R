This is an attempt to create a R package aimed at computing MIDAS models.
Example data (French GDP, French business climate index, financial daily data) and functions are stored into midas_data.RData and functions.RData. You just have to load these two environments. 
These two environments were generated throw the read_data.R and the functions.R scripts.  
Now you can compute midas models that combine polynomials and unrestricted restrictions, or you can compute midas models with exponentials constraints.
